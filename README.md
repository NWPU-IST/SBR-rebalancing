# SBR-rebalancing

1. In our study, we choose six real-world projects of different sizes with over 120,000 bug reports in total as our empirical subjects. We first analyze the impact of the class imbalance issue on SBR prediction and confirm its negative impact on prediction performance. Then we perform a comparative study of six state-of-the-art class rebalancing methods combined with five popular classification algorithms for SBR prediction.

2. By comparing with the baseline method Farsec, using the class rebalancing methods can improve the performance in 78\% of cases in the worst case.
